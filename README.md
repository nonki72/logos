Associative interactive recursive structures

Associative "AI" that is not artificial where everything learned is essentially a lambda calculus primitive so as to blur the line between code and data. If data (such as wordnet synonym sets) can be translated into functional-programming code, then the "AI" can become considerably less complicated, since everything is now described in terms of functions/values, abstractions & applications, and a the log of substitutions made. Functions can be selected filtered by signature, then applied with selected arguments of the proper type, all drawn from a single nosql database. The SQL is used for what I called Equivalence Classes, keeping tally of transformations made given a lambda expression, and creating a probability distribution from which to stochastically draw data based on these associative values (reinforcement learning). Reference materials include books like I-Language: An Introduction to Linguistics as Cognitive Science, and Learn you a Haskell for great good. What i ended up with is a "bot" that is not sandboxed or dependent on libraries for every functionality. For example, by teaching once a simple API function call that can search the web, it suddenly becomes fully connected to all the other things it has learned. In other words, the data/code is flat rather than siloed.
